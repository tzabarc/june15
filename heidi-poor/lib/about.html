            television producer, and occasional actress. In 2008, she became an American citizen while maintaining her
            native German citizenship.</p>

        <p>Klum became internationally known for her appearances on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue.
            In 1997, she became the first German model to become a Victoria's Secret Angel. Following a successful
            modeling career, Klum became the host and a judge of Germany's Next Topmodel and the reality show Project
            Runway which earned her an Emmy nomination in 2008 and a win in 2013 for Outstanding Host for a Reality or
            Reality-Competition Program (shared with co-host Tim Gunn). She has worked as a spokesmodel for Dannon and
            H&M, and has appeared in numerous commercials for McDonald's, Volkswagen and others. In 2009, Klum became
            Barbie's official ambassador on Barbie's 50th anniversary. As an occasional actress, she had supporting
            roles in movies including Blow Dry (2001), Ella Enchanted (2004), and made cameo appearances on The Devil
            Wears Prada (2006) and Perfect Stranger (2007). She has also appeared on TV shows including Sex and the
            City, How I Met Your Mother, and Parks and Recreation. Currently, Klum is a judge on the NBC reality show
            America's Got Talent.</p>

        <p>In May 2011, Forbes magazine estimated Klum's total earnings for that year as $20 million. She is ranked
            second on Forbes' list of the "World's Top-Earning Models", behind Gisele BÃ¼ndchen. Forbes noted that since
            ending her 13-year run as a Victoria's Secret Angel, Klum has become more of a businesswoman than a model.
            She was married to English R&B singer Seal from 2005 until 2012.</p>
